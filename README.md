# layman


Layman is an experimental unstructured layout engine. Instead of providing an explicit structure through a hierarchy or box model, Layman instead represents the layout process as a freeform reactive graph using the Fusion library. 

With Layman, everything exists in a single 3 dimensional coordinate space and is arranged simply as AABB extents using simple reactive operations that compose nicely.

Layman aims to enable layouts that can be difficult or impossible to model in a hierarchical system, and unlocking more animated and dynamic layout powered by data sources outside of the usual intrinsic sizing.
